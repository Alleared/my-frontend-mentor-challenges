Frontend Mentor HTML and CSS challenge "3 Columns Preview Card"('https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/3column-preview-card-component-pH92eAR2-/hub'). I really like how this out turn out. 
I just couldn't figure out how to put some space below the card on the mobile version. Any help with that would be much appreciated.
